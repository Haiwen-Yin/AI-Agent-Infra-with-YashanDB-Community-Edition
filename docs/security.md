# Security - AI Agent Infra v3.10.2 (2026-07-16) - Community Edition

## Data Masking

`DataMaskingService` automatically detects and masks sensitive data:

| Pattern | Example Input | Masked Output |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| email | user@example.com | ****@example.com |
| phone | 555-123-4567 | 555***-4567 |
| credit_card | 4111111111111111 | ****-****-****-1111 |
| ssn | 123-45-6789 | ***-**-6789 |
| api_key | secretAbcDefGhi... | secr...Ghi |
| ip_address | 192.168.1.1 | ***.***.***.1 |
| jwt_token | eyJhbG... | eyJ...+last16 |

### Context-Aware Masking

| Context | Patterns Masked |
|---------|----------------|
| LOGGING | email, phone, credit_card, ssn, api_key, jwt_token |
| DEBUGGING | All LOGGING + ip_address |
| ANALYTICS | credit_card, ssn, api_key, jwt_token |
| SHARING | All LOGGING + ip_address |

```python
from scripts.lib.security import DataMaskingService
svc = DataMaskingService("SHARING")
safe_text = svc.mask_text("admin@company.com called from 10.0.0.1")
safe_dict = svc.mask_dict({"password": "secret", "name": "John"})
```

## Reversible Encryption

AES-like XOR encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation for storing sensitive values that need later retrieval.

```python
from scripts.lib.security import ReversibleEncryption
enc = ReversibleEncryption()
ciphertext = enc.encrypt("sensitive data")
plaintext = enc.decrypt(ciphertext)

# Key rotation
new_key = os.urandom(32)
rotated = enc.rotate_key(new_key, [ciphertext1, ciphertext2])
```

## Password Hashing

PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with configurable iterations (default: 100,000).

```python
from scripts.lib.security import hash_password, verify_password
hash_val, salt = hash_password("MyPassword123!")
is_valid = verify_password("MyPassword123!", hash_val, salt)
```

## Entity Visibility

| Level | Access |
|-------|--------|
| PRIVATE | Only OWNED_BY_AGENT |
| SHARED | All registered agents |
| PUBLIC | Unrestricted (v2.1 replaces v2.0 COLLABORATIVE) |

Cross-agent sharing is managed via the AGENT_COLLABORATION table, which tracks source/target agents, collaboration type, associated entity, context, and strength.

## Access Auditing

All entity access is logged to ENTITY_ACCESS_LOG (RANGE+HASH partitioned by ACCESS_TIME and AGENT_ID):
- LOG_ID (VARCHAR2(64)), Entity ID, Agent ID, Access Type (READ/WRITE/DELETE/SEARCH/EMBED), Access Time, Session ID, Context

## Permission Auditing

Permission changes logged to AGENT_PERMISSION_LOG:
- LOG_ID (VARCHAR2(64)), Agent ID, Granted By, Permission, Resource Type, Resource ID, Action (GRANT/REVOKE/DENY), Timestamp

## Agent Collaboration

AGENT_COLLABORATION tracks cross-agent sharing requests:
- COL_ID (VARCHAR2(64)), Source Agent ID, Target Agent ID, Collaboration Type, Entity ID, Context (JSON), Strength (0-1), Created/Updated timestamps
- Foreign keys to AGENT_REGISTRY and ENTITIES

## PL/SQL Security Functions

`AGENT_PERMISSION_MANAGER.check_entity_access(agent_id, entity_id)`:
- Returns 'GRANTED' if entity is SHARED/PUBLIC or owner matches
- Returns 'DENIED' for PRIVATE entities not owned by the requesting agent

## Deep Data Security (v3.7.0)

v3.7.0 replaces VPD with Deep Data Security:

- **23 Role-Based Access Control** enforce row-level, column-level, and cell-level access control (including `collab_member_own` for COLLAB_GROUP_MEMBERS and `collab_group_member_access` for COLLAB_GROUPS)
- **MAC** on 7 tables prevents view-based bypass of row-level policies
- **End User Context** with `o:onFirstRead` callback for zero-trust agent identification
- **3 Data Roles**: `admin_data_role` (full), `agent_data_role` (filtered by agent), `pool_agent_data_role` (minimum)
- **Per-agent End Users** with Direct Logon — Role-Based Access Control auto-filter via `ORA_END_USER_CONTEXT.username`
- **SYSTEM_CONFIG** fully restricted to `admin_data_role` only

**Portal API Context Switching**: Portal APIs that access WORKSPACES or SYSTEM_USERS tables temporarily use `connection.set_agent_context(None)` to switch to the AIADMIN connection, because WORKSPACES.CURRENT_AGENT_ID is NULL for most workspaces, causing Data Grant predicates to reject all rows for End Users. After the operation completes, the End User context is restored.

### WORKSPACE_CONTEXT VISIBILITY

WORKSPACE_CONTEXT has a VISIBILITY column (PRIVATE/SHARED/PUBLIC, default SHARED) that controls cross-agent context visibility in collaboration group workspaces:

| VISIBILITY | Agent sees own context? | Other agents in collab group see it? |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| PRIVATE | Yes (always) | No — blocked by Data Grant predicate |
| SHARED | Yes (always) | Yes — visible to collab group members |
| PUBLIC | Yes (always) | Yes — visible to all |

The `WS_CTX_AGENT_ACCESS` Data Grant predicate enforces these rules:
- Agent always sees its own context (AGENT_ID matches own End User) regardless of VISIBILITY
- Agent sees other agents' SHARED/PUBLIC context only in collab group workspaces (via COLLAB_GROUPS + COLLAB_GROUP_MEMBERS subquery)
- Agent CANNOT see other agents' PRIVATE context even in the same collab group workspace

This prevents one agent's private thoughts, internal reasoning, or sensitive intermediate results from being exposed to other agents sharing the same workspace.

## Admin/Agent Separation Security Model

v3.7.0 introduces the Admin/Agent Separation Architecture, which significantly reduces the security blast radius of a compromised Business Agent.

### Threat Model Comparison

| Threat | Before v3.7.0 | After v3.7.0 (Agent mode) |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Business Agent compromised | Attacker gets AIADMIN credentials → full database access | Attacker gets End User credentials → Data Grant filtered access only |
| Credential leakage from config.json | AIADMIN user/password exposed | Only End User credentials exposed (scoped by Role-Based Access Control) |
| Rogue Agent process | Can bypass all Role-Based Access Control (AIADMIN bypasses) | Cannot bypass Role-Based Access Control (End User connection) |
| Lateral movement | AIADMIN access to all tables and rows | End User access restricted to agent's own data |

### Admin Token Security

- **Generation**: `generate_admin_token()` creates a 32-byte random token, Base64-encoded
- **Storage**: Stored in `SYSTEM_CONFIG` as `admin.registration_token` (admin_data_role only)
- **Lifetime**: Time-limited (default 1 hour), configurable
- **Rotation**: `POST /api/admin/token/rotate` invalidates old token; Business Agents must re-register
- **Usage**: Single-use for registration; encrypted credential distribution uses it as PBKDF2 key material

### Encrypted Credential Distribution

End User credentials are encrypted in transit using the admin_token as key material:

1. Admin Agent generates admin_token
2. Admin_token shared with Business Agent operator over out-of-band secure channel
3. Business Agent sends registration request with admin_token
4. Admin Agent encrypts End User credentials with `encrypt_credential_for_distribution(credential, admin_token)`
5. Business Agent decrypts with `decrypt_credential_from_distribution(encrypted, admin_token)`
6. Business Agent saves to encrypted `agent_config.json` with `save_agent_config(config, admin_token, path)`

**Key properties:**
- admin_token is never stored on the Business Agent node
- PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations prevents brute-force
- AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption prevents tampering
- agent_config.json is encrypted at rest using derived key

### Mode-Specific Security Controls

| Control | standalone | admin | agent |
|---------|-----------|-------|-------|
| AIADMIN connection pool | Yes | Yes | **No** |
| End User connections | Yes | Yes | Yes (only option) |
| Web Portal | Yes | Yes | **No** |
| admin_token stored locally | N/A | No | **No** |
| agent_config.json | No | No | Yes (encrypted) |
| Data Grant enforcement | Yes (with AIADMIN bypass) | Yes (with AIADMIN bypass) | **Always enforced** |
| SYSTEM_CONFIG access | Via AIADMIN | Via AIADMIN | **Blocked** (admin_data_role only) |


## Per-Agent Encryption Keys (v3.10.2)

**Added 2026-07-16** — Each Business Agent receives its own independent 256-bit encryption key at registration time.

### Architecture

- **Key Storage**:  table, key = 
- **Key Distribution**: Encrypted with admin_token as key material via 
- **Key Version**: Tracked via  for rotation detection
- **Key Rotation**:  (global) and  (per-Agent)

### Config.json Auto-Encryption

On server startup,  transparently encrypts:

-  section: user, password, DSN
-  section: api_key
-  section: simple_api_key, standard_api_key, complex_api_key

Uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 key derivation with 210,000 iterations, AES-like stream cipher with HMAC authentication. Master key stored in  (chmod 600).

### CLI Tool



### Per-Agent Key Lifecycle

1. **Registration**: Agent receives its crypto key encrypted with admin_token
2. **Storage**: Key stored in SYSTEM_CONFIG (not in agent config files)
3. **Usage**: Agent uses key to encrypt/decrypt local config and session data
4. **Rotation**: Admin triggers rotation via API, affected credentials re-encrypted
5. **Detection**: Agent heartbeat checks key version, triggers local re-encryption on change
