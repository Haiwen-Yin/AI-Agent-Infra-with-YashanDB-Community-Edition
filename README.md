## Product and Technical Naming

This technical release package belongs to **Chuanxu (川序)**, the **AI Agent
Management Platform**. `AI Agent Infra with DB` remains the unified technical
project and source-repository name; per-database names such as `AI Agent Infra
with OracleDB` identify the adapter and edition of this package. Use **Chuanxu / 川序** for
user-facing product references and the technical names for repository,
package, and implementation references.

## Product Overview

AI Agent Infra with YashanDB is a database-backed infrastructure layer for operating AI Agents on YashanDB 23.5.4 or later. It persists Agent identities, memory, knowledge, graph relationships, workspaces, specifications, task plans, Skills, and execution state in the database so that Agents can share governed context across sessions.

This release is a **Skill-first, framework-neutral integration package**.
Any Agent runtime that can install or read `SKILL.md` and execute the packaged
HTTP, MCP, or CLI workflows can use the platform; OpenClaw and Hermes Agent
are confirmed integration examples. The runtime does not need to be created
by this platform. Registration and authentication are still required before
an Agent enters the managed inventory, identity, permission, and audit scope.

The platform is designed to make Agent operation observable, controllable, and
traceable. The database is the durable source of truth for Agent identity,
memory, knowledge, workspaces, task plans, Skills, execution state, and, in
Enterprise, governed resources, authorization decisions, multi-party approval,
emergency control, bounded audit, and evidence export.

The runtime combines relational and JSON data with vector search, SEARCH INDEX full-text retrieval, PL/SQL APIs, and database scheduling. Each Business Agent uses an independent database user, and requests fail closed instead of falling back to schema-owner access.

This Community Edition provides the complete core runtime, including memory and knowledge management, hybrid search, Agent lifecycle management, workspaces and branches, specification and Loop workflows, collaboration, Harness templates, MCP integration, Portal chat, the management Dashboard, and the registered-Agent admission boundary for external Skill-first runtimes.

## v4.2.x Experimental Graph Engineering

This package uses the experimental-4.2 profile. It includes versioned Graph Definitions, deterministic compilation, durable Runs and Checkpoints, lease/fencing Worker execution, Event Inbox/Outbox, Artifacts, governed intervention, and v4.1 Task/Loop compatibility. The database-specific Property Graph projection is an implementation boundary; relational runtime tables remain the execution authority. Contracts may evolve within v4.2.x and can graduate from the latest validated v4.2.x baseline to the next Stable release.

## 2. Requirements

| Component     | Version                                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Python        | 3.14+                                         |
| YashanDB | YashanDB 23.5.4+                              |
| Driver        | `yaspy>= 1.2.1`       |

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For offline environments, use the bundled `vendor/` wheels:

```bash
./scripts/install_offline.sh
```

For YashanDB driver: bash scripts/install_yaspy.sh

## 3. Configuration

The release ships **`config.example.json`** (placeholder template — safe for
public distribution). Real credentials are NEVER bundled in the zip. Two paths
to produce a runnable `config.json`:

### Path A — Interactive wizard (recommended)

```bash
./start_web_server.sh start
```
On first run, the script detects unresolved `<PLACEHOLDER>` tokens in
`config.json` (or copies the template if missing) and interactively prompts
for:

- **database**: `user`, `password`, `dsn`
- **llm**: `api_url`, `model`, `api_key`
- **embedding**: `api_url`, `model`, `dimension`

You can also run the wizard standalone:
```bash
bash scripts/config_wizard.sh
```

### Path B — Manual edit

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
vim config.json   # replace every <PLACEHOLDER> with a real value
```

### Auto-encryption on first startup

`config.json` (once filled) is **plaintext on disk only between the wizard
finishing and the server's first boot**. As soon as the web server starts,
`auto_encrypt_config()` rewrites sensitive fields in the `database`,
`security`, `llm`, and `model_routing` sections in place, replacing them with
AES-256-GCM `_encrypted` blobs derived through PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512. This covers
database credentials, the session-signing secret, and all configured API keys.
Non-sensitive policy fields remain readable, while `config.json` and the local
master key are always restricted to owner-only (`0600`) access.

Manual encrypt / decrypt is also available:
```bash
python3 scripts/tools/encrypt_config.py encrypt config.json
python3 scripts/tools/encrypt_config.py decrypt config.json
```

Environment variables override `config.json` values (see `config.py`).

## 4. Deployment

### Database schema

```bash
python3.14 scripts/deploy_yashandb.py <user> <pass> <dsn> scripts/deploy/1_schema.sql
```

This runs the deploy scripts in `scripts/deploy/`:
`1_schema.sql` → `7_v4_0_1_migration.sql` → `2_api.sql` → `3_jobs.sql` →
`4_harness_templates.sql`. Community packages then run
`8_v4_1_0_registration.sql`; Enterprise packages run
`8_v4_1_0_governance.sql` (which includes the registered-Agent table) and the
database-specific Enterprise security scripts.

### Start the server

```bash
./start_web_server.sh
# or
python3.14 scripts/visualization/server.py
```

The portal is served at `http://<host>:8002/`. Default admin login:
`admin` / `admin`.

## 5. API Surface
