## Product and Technical Naming

This technical release package belongs to **Chuanxu (川序)**, the **AI Agent
Management Platform**. `AI Agent Infra with DB` remains the unified technical
project and source-repository name; per-database names such as `AI Agent Infra
with OracleDB` identify the adapter and edition of this package. Use **Chuanxu / 川序** for
user-facing product references and the technical names for repository,
package, and implementation references.

## Product Overview

### Native and External Agent Paths

v4.4.0 adds a database-native governed SDD control plane, deterministic
execution graph, Software Delivery Profile, SCM adapter boundary and evidence
workbench. It preserves the v4.3.7 Bootstrap Deployment Agent for a prepared
database target. It verifies the package manifest, runs only checked package
SQL, records sanitized deployment evidence, retires its temporary identity,
and hands over to the existing platform management Agents. It needs neither an
external Agent nor `psql`; LLM output is never deployment authority. Business
Agents remain subject to a human request and separated approval flow. Existing
external runtimes such as OpenClaw and Hermes continue to use the packaged
`SKILL.md` enrollment path.

### Embedding Contract Governance

Embedding is governed by database-authoritative Profiles, immutable Contract
versions, logical Spaces, and Agent/template/platform bindings. Supported
modes are `PLATFORM_MANAGED`, `ENTERPRISE_DIRECT`, `ENTERPRISE_PROXY`,
`PRECOMPUTED_IMPORT`, and `NONE`. Vector writes and retrieval resolve the
effective Space and Contract first, so different dimensions, normalization,
preprocessing, model identities, or provenance cannot silently mix. Legacy
vectors stay read-only in `LEGACY_DEFAULT` until an authorized re-embedding
cutover. The Dashboard creates audited bindings and bounded jobs only; bulk
embedding runs in the lease-protected `scripts/embedding_worker.py` process.

Chuanxu (川序) is an AI Agent Management Platform whose technical project name is AI Agent Infra with DB. It makes Agent operation observable, controllable, and traceable by keeping identity, memory, knowledge, workspaces, Skills, execution state, and governance facts in a database. This package provides the YashanDB adapter and its Community or Enterprise edition boundary.

This release is a **Skill-first, framework-neutral integration package**.
Any Agent runtime that can install or read `SKILL.md` and execute the packaged
HTTP, MCP, or CLI workflows can use the platform; OpenClaw and Hermes Agent
are confirmed integration examples. The runtime does not need to be created
by this platform. Registration and authentication are still required before
an Agent enters the managed inventory, identity, permission, and audit scope.

The platform is designed to make Agent operation observable, controllable, and
traceable. The database is the durable source of truth for Agent identity,
memory, knowledge, workspaces, task plans, Skills, execution state, and, in
Enterprise, governed resources, authorization decisions, multi-party approval,
emergency control, bounded audit, and evidence export.

v4.3.2 adds governed, versioned Memory on top of the graphical
organization-governance workspace. Each logical Memory has a stable family and
an immutable current version; representations, relations, usage events,
candidates, reviews, snapshots, jobs, and projection work remain attributable
database facts. Normal optimization marks content unavailable or archived and
removes it from ordinary retrieval without routine physical deletion. The
optional model path can only create structured candidates; deterministic
versioning, lineage, representations, and organization remain available with
no LLM configured.

v4.3.3 adds a trustworthy Graph Runtime extension. The database remains the
authority for Runs, Checkpoints, leases, fencing, and audit facts while an
additive assurance layer records recovery evidence and selected invariant
findings. Graph Definition exchange has canonical provenance, dependency locks,
optional Ed25519 signatures, import scanning, and an untrusted-Draft gate.
Dynamic Graph, A2A 1.0.1, and OpenTelemetry mapping are independently
controlled previews: they are disabled in `production`, never grant authority,
and do not add a second execution engine. The tested scope is local runtime
replacement against the reachable database, not database-cluster failover,
RPO, or RTO.

v4.3.4 adds an Enterprise Agent Compliance plane. Registered Agents must
complete their own credential-proven Gateway activation before receiving normal
work tokens. Governed Profiles are immutable after publication, while verified
evidence projects posture, findings, remediation, time-bounded exceptions, and
deterministic restricted or quarantine controls. Prompt instructions, Skill or
API descriptions, and Agent self-reports are never authorization boundaries.
The seeded Compliance Admin identity is credentialless and pending activation;
it is not an autonomous model runtime.

v4.3.5 adds database-authoritative Platform Capability Configuration. An
administrator can reduce the enabled product surface per installation while
mandatory identity, authorization, security, audit-writing, Agent, user, and
configuration controls remain protected. Changes require a reason, dependency
checks, optimistic concurrency, and immutable audit history. This runtime
layer cannot expand the Community/Enterprise package boundary.

v4.3.1 adds a graphical organization-governance workspace. Authorized users
can search and progressively expand a deterministic organization hierarchy,
switch among organization, people, Agent-responsibility, and anomaly views,
and prepare semantic changes without persisting canvas coordinates. Primary
and secondary organization membership, direct/dotted/project reporting, and
Agent accountability remain relational source-of-truth facts. Graph rendering
is an authorized projection and never becomes an access-control boundary.

This Community Edition provides the complete core runtime, including memory and knowledge management, hybrid search, Agent lifecycle management, workspaces and branches, specification and Loop workflows, collaboration, Harness templates, MCP integration, Portal chat, the management Dashboard, Channels, Barriers, and the registered-Agent admission boundary for external Skill-first runtimes.

## Graph Engineering and Runtime Profiles

This package uses the `production` profile in v4.4.0. The shared code line provides versioned Graph Definitions, deterministic compilation, durable Runs and Checkpoints, lease/fencing Worker execution, Event Inbox/Outbox, bounded retry and dead-letter delivery, the versioned Node Executor registry, Barriers, Channels, Artifacts, governed intervention, and v4.1 Task/Loop compatibility. The database-specific Property Graph projection is an implementation boundary; relational runtime tables remain the transaction and recovery authority. v4.3.3 adds assurance evidence, selected invariant scans, canonical Definition provenance, dependency locks, optional Ed25519 verification, and an untrusted-Draft import gate. `production` enables the stable core; `graph-preview` enables only Dynamic Graph, while `development` and `experimental-4.2` additionally enable isolated A2A 1.0.1 and OTLP preview mappings. These previews do not grant authority or prove database failover, independent A2A conformance, or OTLP Collector delivery.

## 2. Requirements

| Component     | Version                                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Python        | 3.14+                                         |
| YashanDB | YashanDB 23.5.4+                              |
| Driver        | `yaspy>= 1.2.1`       |

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For offline environments, use the bundled `vendor/` wheels:

```bash
./scripts/install_offline.sh
```

The release may carry two `cryptography==49.0.0` wheels: a source-built
`manylinux_2_28` wheel for RHEL 8/glibc 2.28 and the upstream `manylinux_2_34`
wheel for newer systems. `pip` and `scripts/verify_deps.py` select the wheel
that matches the host. See `docs/cryptography-build.md` for the reproducible
RHEL 8 build procedure; customers on newer systems do not need to rebuild it.
The verifier also walks the mandatory `Requires-Dist` metadata of selected
wheels. Any transitive wheel required by the base installation must therefore
be present and compatible, even when it is not repeated as a direct pin in
`requirements.txt`; optional extras are excluded.
The current v4.3.5 package contains the verified glibc 2.28 compatibility
wheel, so it is offline-complete on this baseline; `verify_deps.py` still
fails closed rather than using an incompatible newer-host wheel.

For YashanDB driver: bash scripts/install_yaspy.sh

## 3. Configuration

The release ships **`config.example.json`** (placeholder template — safe for
public distribution). Real credentials are NEVER bundled in the zip. Two paths
to produce a runnable `config.json`:

### Path A — Interactive wizard (recommended)

```bash
./start_web_server.sh start
```
On first run, the script detects unresolved `<PLACEHOLDER>` tokens in
`config.json` (or copies the template if missing) and interactively prompts
for:

- **database**: `user`, `password`, `dsn`
- **llm**: `api_url`, `model`, `api_key`
- **embedding**: `api_url`, `model`, `dimension`

You can also run the wizard standalone:
```bash
bash scripts/config_wizard.sh
```

### Path B — Manual edit

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
vim config.json   # replace every <PLACEHOLDER> with a real value
```

### Auto-encryption on first startup

`config.json` (once filled) is **plaintext on disk only between the wizard
finishing and the server's first boot**. As soon as the web server starts,
`auto_encrypt_config()` rewrites sensitive fields in the `database`,
`security`, `llm`, and `model_routing` sections in place, replacing them with
AES-256-GCM `_encrypted` blobs derived through PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512. This covers
database credentials, the session-signing secret, and all configured API keys.
Non-sensitive policy fields remain readable, while `config.json` and the local
master key are always restricted to owner-only (`0600`) access.

Manual encrypt / decrypt is also available:
```bash
"$PYTHON_BIN" scripts/tools/encrypt_config.py encrypt config.json
"$PYTHON_BIN" scripts/tools/encrypt_config.py decrypt config.json
```

Environment variables override `config.json` values (see `config.py`).

## 4. Deployment

### Database schema

```bash
bash scripts/install_platform.sh initialize --database yashandb --edition <community|enterprise> --config config.json
```

This runs the deploy scripts in `scripts/deploy/`:
`1_schema.sql` → `7_v4_0_1_migration.sql` → `2_api.sql` → `3_jobs.sql` →
`4_harness_templates.sql`. Community packages then run
`8_v4_1_0_registration.sql`; Enterprise packages run
`8_v4_1_0_governance.sql` (which includes the registered-Agent table) and the
database-specific Enterprise security scripts. For the integrated v4.3.0
profile, the migration runner then applies the nine common Graph/lifecycle
scripts `9`, `10`, `11`, `12`, `14`, `15`, `16`, `17`, and `18` in numeric dependency
order. Enterprise packages additionally apply
`13_v4_2_0_scheduler_ha.sql` between `12` and `14`; this makes the total nine
scripts for Community and ten for Enterprise in this migration tail.

### Start the server

```bash
./start_web_server.sh
# or, after selecting any Python 3.14+ runtime
source scripts/python_runtime.sh
export PYTHON_BIN="$(cx_resolve_python)"
cx_prepare_python_environment "$PYTHON_BIN"
PYTHONPATH=scripts "$PYTHON_BIN" -m uvicorn web_app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002
```

The Chuanxu application is served at `http://<host>:8002/app/monitor`.
There is no universal default password. Create or approve the first
administrator through the deployment bootstrap procedure, then use the
registration and role workflow documented in `docs/api-reference.md`.

## 5. Using the package

1. Fill `config.json` with the target database and model endpoint settings.
2. Deploy the database schema with the adapter-specific command above.
3. Start the server, complete human login, and create a one-time Agent
   Enrollment Token before registering an external Agent.

The complete HTTP, MCP, Skill, Channel, Barrier, Gateway, and governance
contracts are documented in `SKILL.md` and `docs/api-reference.md`. The package
does not require Node.js at runtime; the offline Web assets are already built.

New integrations should use the canonical Principal-aware v4.3.0 API and its
REST, MCP, or Skill credentials. Established v4.1 routes and Python facades are
legacy compatibility entry points; they remain available during migration but
must not be treated as an authorization bypass or as direct database APIs.

## 6. Testing

```bash
source scripts/python_runtime.sh
export PYTHON_BIN="$(cx_resolve_python)"
cx_prepare_python_environment "$PYTHON_BIN"
"$PYTHON_BIN" -m pytest scripts/tests/ -q --tb=no
```

The generated adapter loads the database connection from a local
owner-only (`0600`) `config.json` in the package root. The shared pytest
fixture environment variables do not replace that runtime file; use the
config wizard or a temporary package copy for database-backed tests, and do
not commit or package the real configuration.

## 7. Community Edition Features

- Full memory/knowledge/graph APIs
- Loop Engineering and Task Plan workflows
- MCP Server and Skill-first external Agent integration
- Portal chat with LLM
- Registered-Agent inventory and lifecycle admission
- Offline deployment
